This project uses SDL2 to implement a civ6 clone game -- intended to be fairly lightweight

Currently uses the following to compile, will fix later. 
g++-13 -g /home/deven/Documents/coding/azaroths-kingdom/ui/main.cpp -o /home/deven/Documents/coding/azaroths-kingdom/ui/main -I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_REENTRANT -lSDL2
